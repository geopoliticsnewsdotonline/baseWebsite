    <h7>The collaborative effort aims to enhance Ukraine's aviation capabilities and improve its defence forces.</h7>

    <p>On Thursday, it was further confirmed that Denmark's Defence Minister and the US Defence Secretary had a meeting to discuss the matter in detail.
      
      In addition, several other countries are also expected to take part in the training.</p>
      
     <p> "The first step is to find out which countries will be involved in carrying out the training mission, and we are doing that now. In regards to this, Denmark is ready to play a central role together with the Netherlands," Denmark's defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, told the Ritzau newswire after the announcement. .
      
      "The US Defence Secretary recognised Danish support for Ukraine and our work in developing solutions for the continued support for the Ukrainians."
      
      He added that it had "yet to be clarified" whether the training offer meant that Denmark would also donate jets to Ukraine but noted that the agreement is "an important strategic step in the long term."</p>  
    <p>Denmark's defence minister first stated that Denmark would start discussions on how to train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 combat aircraft last Friday.

      The statement was made after US President Joe Biden announced earlier that day that the US supports a joint effort to train Ukrainian pilots.</p>
      
     <p> Poulsen has also said that he expects several countries to cooperate on the F-16 pilot training.
      
      After meeting other European defence ministers in Warsaw, Poland, last Monday, he said he was "very optimistic after the discussion we had today."</p>
      
      <p>"Belgium, Great Britain, and the Netherlands have already said that they will join, but I clearly sense that several countries will also join the coalition of countries that will carry out educational activities for the Ukrainian pilots," he said, adding that more concrete information would likely be announced in the next couple of weeks.
