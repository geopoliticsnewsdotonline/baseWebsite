    <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will travel to the United States for an official visit in late October, the first since winning election last year, according to a statement from his office on Thursday.

      The leaders will hold talks on topics including the AUKUS security deal, climate change and critical minerals during the four-day visit from Oct. 23-26.
      
      “My visit is an important opportunity to discuss our ambitious climate and clean energy transition, and shared goal of a strong, secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific,” Albanese said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The trip comes at a time when mutual concerns about China's rise are pushing the long-standing security partners closer together, most notably with the AUKUS deal, which will see Australia buy several U.S. Virginia class submarines and contribute billions to expanding American shipyards.

        Biden had originally planned to travel to Sydney in May for a meeting of Quad, an informal regional group made up of Australia, India, Japan and the U.S., but canceled due to debt ceiling negotiations in Washington.</p>
        <p>The four leaders instead met in May on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Hiroshima.

          The White House said in a statement issued on Wednesday that the visit underscored both nations' commitment to an open, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.
          
          Albanese has also been invited to visit Beijing but has yet to set a date for a trip.</p>
