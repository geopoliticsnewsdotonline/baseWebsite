    <P>The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of AH-64E Apache helicopters and related equipment to Poland in a deal valued at up to $12 billion, the Pentagon said on Monday.

      NATO-member Poland has requested 96 of the Apache attack helicopters and related equipment, including 1,844 Hellfire missiles and 508 Stinger missiles, the Pentagon said.
      
      Poland has made boosting its military a priority following Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine.
      
      The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified the U.S. Congress of the possible sale on Monday.</P>
      <P>Despite approval by the State Department, the notification does not indicate that a contract has been signed or that negotiations have concluded.

        The Pentagon said Boeing (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) are the prime contractors for the weapons.</P>
