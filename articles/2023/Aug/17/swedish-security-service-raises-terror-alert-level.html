    <p>Sweden's security service, SAPO, said on Thursday it was raising its assessment of the level of threat against Sweden to 4 on a scale of 5 amid mounting international tension over the burning of copies of the Koran at demonstrations in the Nordic country.</p>
    <p>"The threat against Sweden has gradually changed and the threat of attacks from actors within violent Islamism has increased during the year," the security service said in a statement.

      SAPO said Sweden had gone from being regarded as a legitimate target for terrorist attacks to being regarded as a priority target.</p>
