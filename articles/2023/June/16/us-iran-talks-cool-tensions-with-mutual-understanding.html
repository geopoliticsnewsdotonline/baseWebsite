    <h3>US, Iran in talks to cool tensions with a mutual 'understanding'</h3>

  <p>The United States is holding talks with Iran to sketch out steps that could limit the Iranian nuclear programme, release some detained U.S. citizens and unfreeze some Iranian assets abroad, according to Iranian and Western officials.</p>
  <p>These steps would be cast as an "understanding" rather than an agreement requiring review by the U.S. Congress, where many lawmakers oppose giving Iran benefits because of its military aid to Russia, its domestic repression and its support for proxies that have attacked U.S. interests in the region.</p>
  <p>Having failed to revive a 2015 Iran nuclear deal, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration hopes to restore some limits on Iran to keep it from getting a nuclear weapon that could threaten Israel and trigger a regional arms race. Iran says it has no ambition to develop a nuclear weapon.</p>
  <p>The 2015 deal, which then-President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018, had capped Iran's uranium enrichment at 3.67% purity and its stockpile of this material at 202.8 kg (447 pounds) - limits Tehran has since far exceeded.

    U.S. and European officials have been searching for ways to curb Tehran's nuclear efforts since the breakdown of indirect American-Iranian talks. The willingness to restart discussions illustrates the rising sense of urgency in Western capitals about Iran's programme.</p>
    <p>The U.S. government has dismissed reports it is seeking an interim deal, using carefully constructed denials that leave open the possibility of a less formal "understanding" that could avoid congressional review.</p>
    <p>State Department spokesperson Matt Miller denied there was any deal with Iran.

      However, Miller said the United States wants Iran to de-escalate tensions and curb its nuclear programme, cease support for regional proxy groups that carry out attacks, halt support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and release detained American citizens.
      
      "We continue to use diplomatic engagements to pursue all of these goals," Miller added, without giving details.</p>
      <p>An Iranian official said, "Call it whatever you want, whether a temporary deal, an interim deal or a mutual understanding - both sides want to prevent further escalation."

        In the first instance, "that will involve prisoner exchange and unblocking part of Iran's frozen assets", the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
        
        Further steps might include U.S. sanctions waivers for Iran to export oil in return for ceasing 60% uranium enrichment and greater Iranian cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the official said.</p>
