    <h3>NATO meeting fails to approve first defense plans since Cold War</h3>

    <p>NATO defense ministers failed on Friday to reach agreement over new plans on how the alliance would respond to a Russian attack, and one diplomat blamed Turkey for blocking them.</p>
    <p>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the ministers reviewed the plans - the first since the end of the Cold War and given impetus by Russia's invasion of Ukraine - at a two-day meeting in Brussels and were moving closer to agreeing on them.</p>
    <p>But one diplomat said Turkey had blocked approval over the wording of geographical locations, including with regard to Cyprus. There was still an opportunity to find a solution before the NATO summit in mid-July in Vilnius, the diplomat added.

      Turkey's diplomatic mission to NATO said it would be wrong to comment on a secret NATO document, adding only that "the usual process of consultations and evaluation among allies is continuing".</p>
      <p>The so-called regional plans comprise thousands of pages of secret military plans that will detail how the alliance would respond to a Russian attack.

        The drawing up of the documents signifies a fundamental shift. NATO had seen no need for large-scale defense plans for decades as it fought smaller wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and felt certain post-Soviet Russia no longer posed an existential threat.</p>
        <p>But with Europe's bloodiest war since 1945 raging just beyond its borders in Ukraine, the alliance is now warning that it must have all planning in place well before a conflict with a peer adversary such as Moscow might erupt.</p>
        <p>NATO will also give nations guidance on how to upgrade their forces and logistics.</p>
        <p>"While regional plans were not formally endorsed today, we anticipate these plans will be part of a series of deliverables for the Vilnius Summit in July," a senior U.S. official told Reuters.</p>
