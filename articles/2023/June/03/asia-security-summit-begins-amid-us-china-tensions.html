    <p>Asia’s top security meeting has opened with intensifying competition between the United States and China expected to dominate a weekend of high-level speeches, backroom military dealings and delicate diplomacy.</p>
    <p>The Shangri-La Dialogue, which attracts senior military officers, diplomats, weapons makers and security analysts from around the globe, is taking place from Friday to Sunday in Singapore.</p>
    <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will deliver the keynote address on Friday evening while United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and China’s new defence minister, Li Shangfu, are expected to trade barbs in speeches over the weekend.</p>
    <p>The relationship between the US and China is at its lowest point in decades as the two superpowers remain deeply divided over everything from the sovereignty of Taiwan to cyber espionage and territorial disputes in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Hopes that the summit in Singapore could be a chance to mend ties between Washington and Beijing were dealt a blow last week when Li declined an offer to meet with Austin.

      Li, who was named China’s defence minister in March, was sanctioned by the US in 2018 over weapons purchases from Russia.</p>
      <p>There was a brief moment of Sino-American dialogue at the summit during a sideline session on cybersecurity.

        US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said, “We should be talking to China,” after being asked a question from Chinese Senior Colonel Zhu Qichao about collaborating on cybersecurity risks associated with artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>Aaron Connelly, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, has said that Chinese and US defence ministers will not talk to each other at this year’s event, which is unusual.</p>
        <p>“This is usually one of the only occasions in the year that American and Chinese ministers talk to each other, but that is not happening this year,” he told Al Jazeera from the summit in Singapore.</p>
