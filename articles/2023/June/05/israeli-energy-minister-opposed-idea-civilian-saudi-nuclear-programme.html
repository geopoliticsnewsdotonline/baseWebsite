  <p> Israel's energy minister voiced opposition on Monday to the idea of Saudi Arabia developing a civilian nuclear programme as part of any U.S.-mediated forging of relations between the countries.</p>
  <p>The New York Times reported in March that such a programme was among Riyadh's conditions for a normalisation deal with Israel. Saudi and U.S. officials have not confirmed that.</p>
  <p>Pointing to precedents like Iraq and Libya, Israel has long worried that potentially hostile neighbours could use civilian nuclear energy and other projects developed under the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as cover for clandestine bomb-making.</p>
  <p>"Naturally, Israel does not encourage such things. I don't think Israel should agree to such things," Energy Minister Israel Katz told Ynet TV when asked about a prospective Saudi civilian nuclear programme as part of possible bilateral ties.</p>
  <p>Israel said last week it expected to be consulted by Washington on any U.S.-Saudi deal affecting its national security. Israel, which is outside the voluntary NPT and has no nuclear energy, is widely believed to have atomic weaponry.</p>
