    <p>NATO leaders will not issue an invitation for Ukraine to join the alliance at a summit in Vilnius in mid-July, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday.</p>
    <p>"At the Vilnius summit and in the preparations for the summit, we are not discussing to issue a formal invitation," he told reporters after meeting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin, adding leaders would talk about how to move Ukraine closer to NATO.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Stoltenberg warned against accepting a frozen conflict in Ukraine in return for an end to the war.

      "We all want this war to end, but a just peace cannot mean freezing the conflict and accepting a deal dictated by Russia," he said.</p>
