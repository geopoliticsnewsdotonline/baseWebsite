   <p> Denmark's military support to Ukraine will be increased to 21.9 billion Danish crowns ($3.21 billion) during 2023-2028, the Danish defence ministry said in a statement on Monday.</p>
   <p>The aid will be delivered through a Ukraine fund Denmark set up in March as part of the small Nordic nation's ambition "to be among the most significant supporters of Ukraine".

    The fund was set at 7 billion Danish crowns, to be spent on humanitarian, business recovery and military needs. It is not immediately clear how much of that has been paid out.</p>
    <p>"I am proud that Denmark will continue to be a significant contributor. Ukraine remains deeply dependent on military aid," acting Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said in a statement.</p>
