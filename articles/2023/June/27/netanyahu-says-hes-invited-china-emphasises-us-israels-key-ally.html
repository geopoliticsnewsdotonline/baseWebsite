    <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had been invited to China in an announcement on Tuesday in which he also emphasised that the United States remained Israel's key ally.</p>
    <p>U.S. President Joe Biden's administration was notified of the expected visit a month ago, the statement from Netanyahu's office said. Washington has been scrutinizing Israeli commercial ties to its Asian big-power rival.

      China and the United States agreed this month to stabilize their intense rivalry so it does not veer into conflict but failed to produce any major breakthrough during a rare visit to Beijing by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>
      <p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also visited Beijing in June, where Chinese President Xi Jinping told him China was willing to help promote peace talks with Israel. U.S.-brokered negotiations have been frozen since 2014.</p>
