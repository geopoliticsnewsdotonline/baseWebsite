    <h3>Plan to train Ukrainian F-16 pilots still in the works, Denmark says</h3>

    <p>An international programme to train Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16 fighter jets is still being drawn up by Western countries and the length of such a course could vary depending on the pilots' prior training and language skills, Denmark said on Tuesday.</p>
    <p>NATO members Denmark and the Netherlands are leading efforts by an international coalition to train pilots and support staff, maintain aircraft and ultimately supply F-16s to Ukraine.</p>
    <p>"The dialogue and planning of this is still ongoing, which is why there is no final plan yet," Denmark's defence ministry said in a statement to Reuters.

      Kyiv, which has launched a counteroffensive against Russian forces, has repeatedly called for Western countries to supply aircraft and train its pilots to fly them, to successfully counter Moscow's aerial dominance.</p>
      <p>So far, no countries have committed to sending F-16s to Ukraine, though Poland and Slovakia have supplied 27 MiG-29s to supplement Ukraine's fleet.

        Denmark expects to be able to train up to six Ukrainian pilots at a time, along with up to 40 soldiers for preparation and maintenance work, the defence ministry said.</p>
        <p>The ministry could not say how long it would take to finish the training. "It depends on their fighter experience and language skills," it said.</p>
