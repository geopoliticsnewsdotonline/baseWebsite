  <p>French President Emmanuel Macron warned Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi on Saturday about the consequences of delivering drones to Russia, Macron's office said on Saturday.

    In a phone call, Macron urged Iran to "immediately cease" the support it is giving Russia in the war against Ukraine.</p>
    <p>Macron also expressed concerns about the trajectory of the Iranian nuclear programme, the statement said.

      Britain, France, Germany, the United States and Ukraine say the supply of Iranian-made drones to Russia violates a 2015 U.N. Security Council resolution enshrining the Iran nuclear deal.</p>
      <p>The White House said on Friday that Russia appeared to be deepening its defense cooperation with Iran and had received hundreds of one-way attack drones that it is using to strike Ukraine.</p>
