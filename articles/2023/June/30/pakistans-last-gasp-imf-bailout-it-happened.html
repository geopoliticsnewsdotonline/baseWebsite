    <h3>Pakistan's last-gasp IMF bailout as it happened</h3>

   <p>Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to release $3 billion in critical bailout funds following a long drawn-out review process for the cash-strapped economy since November last year.</p>
   <p>The agreement is under a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), as the existing Extended Financing Facility (EFF) programme signed in 2019 expires later on Friday.</p>
   <p>Here are some facts about the lead up to the last-gasp agreement:</p>
    <p>-May 2019: IMF approves a $6 billion, 39-month bailout package for Pakistan under the EFF struck with the government of then Prime Minister Imran Khan.</p>
    <p>-April 2022: Khan's government is removed in a parliamentary vote of no confidence. Shehbaz Sharif takes over as Prime Minister as the country reels from economic and political turmoil.</p>
    <p>-July 2022: IMF and Pakistan reach staff-level agreement for the release of about $1.2 billion in the last successful EFF review until the SBA.</p>
    <p>-Aug 2022: The IMF board approves the seventh and eighth reviews of the bailout programme, allowing for a release of over $1.1 billion and an extension by a year.</p>
    <p>-Sept 2022: Miftah Ismail resigns as finance minister, the fifth such minister to be replaced in less than four years.</p>
    <p>Ishaq Dar takes over as finance minister for his fourth stint in the job, with Pakistan's next staff review, the ninth under the EFF, and funds tranche due in November.</p>
    <p>-Nov 2023: Pakistan, IMF begin virtual engagement for the ninth review of the loan programme. A staff delegation visit does not materialise due to differences on programme targets, and Dar hits out at the IMF for the delay.</p>
    <p>-Jan 2023: Pakistan reiterates commitment to completing the IMF programme in a meeting on the sidelines of a climate conference in Geneva.

      An IMF staff delegation visits Pakistan after weeks of delays, but the 10-day visit concludes without an agreement to send the matter to the board, increasing economic uncertainty.</p>
      <p>-Feb 2023: Pakistan, IMF decide to resume talks virtually on steps needed to secure an agreement for the ninth review.</p>
      <p>-May 2023: IMF mission chief says continuing to work with Pakistani authorities to bring the ninth review to conclusion once necessary financing is in place.</p>
      <p>-June 22, 2023: Sharif meets IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva in Paris, looking to secure a last minute release of the stalled funds before the programme expires on June 30.</p>
      <p>-June 24, 2023: Pakistan changes its budget for the financial year starting on July 1, including the latest fiscal tightening measures dictated by the IMF.</p>
      <p>-June 26, 2023: Pakistan's central bank raises its benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points to 22% at an emergency meeting days before IMF programme expires.</p>
      <p>-June 30, 2023: IMF reaches staff-level agreement with Pakistan on $3 billion funding, which is spread over nine months and is higher than expected. The country was awaiting the release of the remaining $2.5 billion from the $6.5 billion bailout package agreed in 2019, which was expiring on Friday.</p>
