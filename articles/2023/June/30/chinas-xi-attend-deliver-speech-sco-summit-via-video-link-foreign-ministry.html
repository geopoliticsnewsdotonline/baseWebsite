    <p>China's President Xi Jinping will attend and deliver a speech at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) via video link on July 4, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Friday.</p>
    <p>India, as the chair nation of this year's summit of the SCO Council of Heads of State, announced in May that it would hold the event in a virtual format.

      Defence and foreign ministers of the bloc attended in-person meetings in India this year.</p>
      <p>The SCO is a political and security union of countries spanning much of Eurasia, including China, India and Russia.</p>
      <p>Formed in 2001 by Russia, China and former Soviet states in Central Asia, the body has been expanded to include India and Pakistan, with a view to playing a bigger role as counterweight to Western influence in the region.</p>
      <p>Kazakhstan will take over the presidency of the SCO after the July summit.</p>
