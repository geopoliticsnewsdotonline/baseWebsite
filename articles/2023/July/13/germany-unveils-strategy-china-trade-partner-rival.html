      <p>STATEMENTS</p>
      <p>GERMAN CHANCELLOR OLAF SCHOLZ</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The goal is not to decouple. But we want to avoid critical dependencies in the future.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER ANNALENA BAERBOCK </p>
      <p>&ldquo;We want to diversify but we want to further expand and make use of cooperation with China at the same time. This applies to our economic contacts because we neither want to hamper China&rsquo;s economic development nor our own.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We will protect the European economy against unfair competition by developing new and above all European tools and then jointly using them &ndash; for example the instrument against coercive measures, in which we can if necessary protect European companies against attempts to coerce by third countries, if need be including with customs or trade restrictions.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We cannot be indifferent on the tension surrounding Taiwan. A military escalation would also be a danger to millions of people, worldwide, meaning also for us.&rdquo;</p>
