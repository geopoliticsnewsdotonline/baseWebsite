    <P>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive Board meeting on Pakistan has been scheduled for July 12, the lender confirmed in email on Wednesday.</P>
    <P>Pakistan secured a badly needed $3 billion stand-by arrangement (SBA) from the International Monetary Fund on Friday, giving the South Asian economy a much-awaited respite as it teeters on the brink of default.</P>
    <P>The staff level agreement on the SBA is subject to approval by the IMF Executive board.</P>
    <P>The previous Extended Fund Facility expired on June 30, with the 9th, 10th, and 11th reviews pending.</P>
