 <p>South Korea will announce on Friday its own assessment of Japan's plan to release treated radioactive water from the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima plant into the ocean, a senior government official said.</p>
 <p>The announcement will come after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) approved Japan's plans on Tuesday, saying they were consistent with global safety standards and would have a "negligible radiological impact to people and the environment".</p>
 <p>"We are currently at the final stage ... and will be able to explain the results at tomorrow's daily briefing," Park Ku-yeon, a vice-ministerial official at South Korea's Office for Government Policy Coordination, told reporters.</p>
 <p>The administration of President Yoon Suk Yeol has faced a tricky line responding to the issue given improving relations with Japan, just as the risk of a broader consumer backlash persists.</p>
