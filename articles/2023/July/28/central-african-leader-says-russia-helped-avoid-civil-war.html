     <p>Central African Republic President Faustin Archange Touadera said on Friday his country's relations with Russia had helped it to save its democracy and avoid a civil war.

      Russian mercenaries, including many from the Wagner militia, intervened in 2018 on the side of the government to quell a civil war that has raged since 2012.
      
      The Russian ambassador to the CAR said in February that 1,890 "Russian instructors" were present.</p>
      <p>A Wagner contingent arrived in CAR this month to help secure a constitutional referendum on July 30.</p>
