   <p>Israel has approved the purchase of a third squadron of F-35 stealth fighter jets in a deal worth $3 billion, the Ministry of Defense said on Sunday.</p>
   <p>The additional 25 aircraft manufactured by Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) will bring the number of F-35s in Israel's air force to 75, the ministry said, adding that the deal will be financed through the defense aid package Israel receives from the United States.</p>
   <p>Israel was the first country outside the United States to acquire the F-35. In May 2018 its air force chief said that Israel was the first to use the plane in combat.

    The F-35 is also known as the Joint Strike Fighter and in Israel by its Hebrew name “Adir” (Mighty).</p>
    <p>Lockheed Martin and engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney have agreed to involve Israeli defense companies in the production of aircraft components, the Israeli ministry added.</p>
