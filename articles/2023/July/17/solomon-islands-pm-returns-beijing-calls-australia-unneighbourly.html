   <p>Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manesseh Sogavare returned to Honiara on Monday after a week-long official visit to China, telling reporters Beijing would provide more budget support, and that criticism by Australia was "unneighbourly".</p>
   <p>The United States, Australia, New Zealand and Solomon Islands' opposition party have called for Sogavare to publish details of a policing deal signed in Beijing last week, amid concern it will invite further regional contest.</p>
   <p>Sogavare told a press conference on Monday in Honiara that Australia and the U.S. should not fear China's police support for Solomon Islands , ABC Television reported.

    "Targeting China-Solomon Islands relations is ... un-neighbourly and lacks respect," he said.</p>
    <p>China had agreed to provide budget support for Solomon Islands, he added.

      Australia has historically been Solomon Islands' largest aid donor and security partner.</p>
