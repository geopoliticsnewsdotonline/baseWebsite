    <p>The Honduran government on Friday told Chinese officials it is seeking investors to help fund construction of a proposed $20 billion rail line connecting the country's Atlantic and Pacific coasts, part of a binational trade and investment push.</p>
    <p>Honduras and China have been negotiating a first-ever free trade pact linking their economies. Fredy Cerrato, the Honduran economic development minister, told reporters officials from both countries also discussed infrastructure projects relating to dams and power generation.</p>
    <p>"We presented (Chinese officials) with the projects that Honduras is interested in getting financed, that are vital for the development of our country," said Cerrato.

      "We're talking about building dams, the construction of an transoceanic train that also has to do with our electric generation system," said Cerrato.</p>
      <p>He added that officials in China, the world's second largest economy, have shown interest in projects developed using both public and private funds.</p>
      <p>The minister added that proposed train line could be ready in about 15 years.</p>
      <p>Honduras and the Asian giant launched diplomatic relations in March, after the Central American nation ditched its longstanding ties with Taiwan in favor of mainland China and its economic leverage.</p>
