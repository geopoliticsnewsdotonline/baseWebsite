    <h3> Argentina delegation set to travel to US next week for IMF talks</h3>
    <h6>July 07, 2023</h6>

   <p>The Argentine government will send a delegation next week to Washington in a bid to finalize the renegotiation of its $44 billion loan with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), a source involved in the talks told Reuters on Friday.</p>
   <p>The delegation had initially planned to travel as early as June, in a sign of potential hold-ups.</p>
   <p>The third largest economy in Latin America intends to change the scheduling of the advance disbursements set for the rest of the year, in the midst of soaring inflation, a weakening peso and diminished central bank dollar reserves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The negotiation is fine, next week our team will be there (in Washington) all week. We are very close (to an agreement),&rdquo;&nbsp; the source said on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>However, Grupo SBS said in a note that the renegotiation with the IMF rests on changing the exchange rate through a currency devaluation, but that &ldquo;the government continues to refuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Argentines will go to the polls in August to vote in the primary elections, where Economy Minister Sergio Massa is a candidate to become president, before the general election in October.</p>
<p>The grain-producing country is seeking to renegotiate its credit program with the IMF after a historic drought hit soybean and corn crops, its main source of export income.</p>
<p>In June,&nbsp;Argentina was forced to pay the IMF $2.7 billion in debt using the last reserves of its Special Drawing Rights (SDR) and the Chinese yuan currency so as not to weaken its US dollar reserves.    </p>
<p>The government also this week postponed its $2.6 billion loan repayments for July until the end of the month, which include $1.3 billion that were due Friday.</p>
