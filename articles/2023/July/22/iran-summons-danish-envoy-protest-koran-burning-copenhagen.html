    <p> Iran's foreign ministry summoned the Danish ambassador to protest against "the desecration of the Koran in Copenhagen," the ministry tweeted on Saturday.</p>
    <p>On Friday, a man set fire to a book purported to be the Koran on a square across from the Iraqi Embassy in Copenhagen.</p>
    <p>"Book burning in Europe is reminiscent of the dark ages of ignorance... Silence in the face of such a heinous cultural crime will only lead to violence and promotion of terrorism," Iranian media quoted a senior foreign ministry official as saying.</p>
