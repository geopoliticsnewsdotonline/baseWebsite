   <p>Belarus applied in May to join the BRICS club of five leading developing economies, Russia's RIA Novosti news agency reported on Tuesday.</p>
   <p>"This decision was an absolutely logical step in the context of... expanding cooperation in multilateral formats with traditional partners and friendly states," the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said, according to RIA.</p>
   <p>The BRICS countries Brazil, India, China and South Africa have all declined to join Western economic sanctions against fellow member Russia over its war in Ukraine, which Moscow calls a "special military operation". They are due to hold a summit in South Africa in August.</p>
   <p>Belarus, a close ally of Moscow also subject to Western sanctions - for suppressing dissent and allowing Russia to use its territory as a platform for the invasion of Ukraine - said 25 states had already applied to join the BRICS club.</p>
   <p>It said the BRICS members were discussing whether to set criteria for membership, or perhaps to establish a parallel forum of BRICS partner countries.

    "The importance and influence of BRICS in the world will steadily increase," the ministry was quoted as saying.</p>
