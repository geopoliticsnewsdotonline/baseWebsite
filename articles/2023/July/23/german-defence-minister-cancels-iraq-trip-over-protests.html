    <p>German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has cancelled a planned trip to Iraq and Jordan, a ministry spokesperson said on Sunday, citing security concerns after the Swedish Embassy in Baghdad was set alight last week in a protest over Koran burnings.</p>
    <p>On Saturday, several thousand Iraqis demonstrated in Baghdad over the recent burning or damaging of the Koran during anti-Islam protests in Sweden and Denmark.</p>
    <p>The cancellation of Pistorius' trip, which was supposed to last for several days, was also in response to violent protests against a Danish non-governmental organisation in Iraq, the spokesperson said.</p>
    <p>This, along with the risk of further protests in coming days, prompted German security forces to advise on cancelling the trip, the spokesperson said, adding it would take place at a later date, possibly during the fourth quarter of the year.</p>
